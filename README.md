This jupyter notebook describes my attempt to run DDoS detection algorithm based on paper by David, J., & Thomas, C. (2019). "Efficient DDoS flood attack detection using dynamic thresholding on flow-based network traffic"[[1]](#1) using DARPA 2000 dataset[[2]](#2).

I did not come up with the algorithm myself, you can refer to the paper for clearer explanation. 

My complete implementation of the Dynamic Thresholding Algorithm can be seen at other repo[[3]](#3).
